1. Change in hal-config.h
	#define HAL_VCOM_ENABLE                   (0)
	TO 
	#define HAL_VCOM_ENABLE                   (1)

2. 
	2.1 Copy "retargetserialhalconfig.h" 
	From: ${StudioSdkPath}\hardware\kit\common\halconfig 
	To:   {projectPath}\hardware\kit\common\halconfig
	*IF NOT ALREADY PRESENT

	2.2 Copy "retargetio.c", "retargetserial.c", "retargetserial.h"  
	From: {SDKPATH}\hardware\kit\common\drivers 
	To:   {projectPath}\hardware\kit\common\drivers
	*IF NOT ALREADY PRESENT

3. 
	3.1 In main.c file
		Include #include "retargetserial.h"

	3.2 Call the below functions in main before while(1)
		RETARGET_SerialInit();
		RETARGET_SerialCrLf(true);		//this is used for proper display of the UART on TERA TERM. If TERA TERM settings are changed, this line can be avoided

	And use normal printf to write data to the UART.
